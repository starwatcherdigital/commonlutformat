This document introduces a human-readable text file format for the interchange of
color transformations using an XML schema. The XML format supports Look-Up
Tables of several types: 1D LUTs, 3D LUTs, and 3by1D LUTs, as well as additional
transformation needs such as matrices, range rescaling, and ‘shaper LUTs’. The
document defines a processing model for color transformations where each
transformation is defined by a ‘Node’ that operates upon a stream of image pixels.
A node contains the data for a transformation, and a sequence of nodes can be
specified in which the output of one transform feeds into the input of another node.
The XML representation allows saving in a text file both a chain of multiple nodes
or a single node representing a unique transform. The format is extensible and selfcontained
so the XML file may be used as an archival element.
